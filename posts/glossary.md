This is intended as a glossary which doubles as a structured introduction or
refresher to the relevant endocrinology and medications when read from top to
bottom.

- ERs, estrogen receptors, oestrogen receptors: The primary female sex hormone
  receptors
- E, estrogens, oestrogen: Molecules activating estrogen receptors
  - E2, estradiol, oestradiol: the primary estrogen
    - estradiol esters: A group of molecules which consist of estradiol together
      with an ester group which are converted to estradiol in the body
      - EV, estradiol valerate: A commonly used estradiol ester
      - EC, estradiol cypionate: A somewhat less commonly used estradiol ester
        which has a longer duration of action than EV when used as an injection
  - E1, estrone, oestrone: another estrogen that is much weaker in potency than
    estradiol.
  - EE, ethinyl estradiol: A synthetic estrogen commonly used in birth control,
    due to it's improved menstruation control. It is not used in transfeminine
    HRT anymore, due to it's increased risk of VTE
  - CEs, CEEs, conjugated (equine) estrogens: Another synthetic estrogen which
    isn't used in transfeminine HRT anymore for the same reasons as EE.
- ARs, androgen receptors: The primary male sex hormone receptors
- androgens: Molecules activating androgen receptors
  - T, testosterone: The primary androgen
  - DHT, dihydrotestosterone: An androgen converted from testosterone which is
    much more potent and is responsible for male pattern baldness
- antiandrogen, AA, T blocker, androgen blocker: A drug that blocks the
  production or effects in the body of androgens.
- ARA, AR antagonist: A molecule which blocks the action of androgens at the
  androgen receptors.
  - spironolactone, spiro: An ARA commonly used inside the US
  - bicalutamide, bica: A newer ARA that works more selectively than
    spironolactone, is more potent, and has less side-effects
- PRs, progesterone receptor: Another female sex hormone receptor
- progestogens, progestagens, gestagens: Molecules activating progesterone
  receptors, they are often used to suppress the production of sex steroids in
  the gonads due to their antigonadotropic effect (see below)
  - P4, progesterone: The primary progestogen
  - progestins: Synthetic progestogens
    - CPA, cyproterone acetate: A very potent progestin with a long duration of
      action that is commonly used outside of the US, but is not approved for
      use inside the US.
    - MPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate: Another progestin that is approved for
      use inside the US.
      - DMPA, depot MPA: An injectable form of MPA with a very long duration of
        action of over a month.
- gonadotropins: Hormones that facilitate the production of sex steroids in the
  gonads
  - LH: a gonadotropin
  - FSH: a gonadotropin
- GnRH, gonadotropin releasing hormone: A hormone that facilitates the release
  of gonadotropins from the pituitary
- antigonadotropin: A drug that suppresses the activity of gonadotropins and thus
  stops the production of sex hormones in the gonads.
  - GnRH (receptor) modulator: A drug that suppresses the activity of GnRH thus
    stopping the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary 
    - GnRH (receptor) antagonist: A molecule that blocks the activity of GnRH at
      the GnRH receptor
    - GnRH (receptor) agonist: A molecule that activates the GnRH receptor. With
      continuous high activation the receptor becomes almost completely,
      temporarily desensitised leading to the effect being inverted. Thus,
      somewhat unintuitively, GnRH agonists have the same effect as GnRH
      antagonists and can be used as antigonadotropins
  - Both estrogens and progestogens have antigonadotropic effects by stopping
    the production of gonadotropins in the pituitary. 
- enzyme: A protein which converts some molecules to other molecules. For
  example lactase is responsible for converting lactose to simple sugers. A
  lactose intolerance is caused by the body ceasing it's production of lactase.
- aromatase: An enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol
- 5-α-reductase: An enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT
- 5-α-reductase inhibitor, 5α-RI, 5-ARI, DHT blocker: A molecule that blocks the
  activity of 5-α-reductase. These are commonly used to combat male pattern
  baldness and can also be used in transfeminine HRT. They can however only
  block the production of DHT and are not capable of controlling the effects of
  testosterone in the body. Thus they are not suitable as an AA on their own.
  - finasteride: A 5-ARI
  - dutasteride: A 5-ARI
